- After clicking `Performance test`, it shows the following panel. After running tests on a few HDDs, it seems that the read speed is approx 250 MBPs.

- Using 3 HDDs for now in RAID 5 mode (saves against 1 HDD failure and provides N/2 storage space).

- After submitting the request, wait for a few minutes and you'll have your NAS volume ready to use.
