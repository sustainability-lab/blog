## Terminology
- `NAS`: Network Attached Storage Device
- `HOST`: The server where the NAS volume is mounted

## Create the Volume

- Open NAS web interface in a browser by IP address (currently, `10.0.62.201`) and login with an admin access account.
- Homepage may look like this:

- Checking the storage space and number of HDDs installed. It shows total 12 slots and 6 slots filled with HDDs.

- After clicking `Performance test`, it shows the following panel. After running tests on a few HDDs, it seems that the read speed is approx 250 MBPs.

- We need to create a volume to store data.

- Choosing `Static Volume` to get maximum read/write speed.

- Using 3 HDDs for now in RAID 5 mode (saves against 1 HDD failure and provides N/2 storage space).

- After submitting the request, wait for a few minutes and you'll have your NAS volume ready to use.

- By default, `Public` folder is created in the volume.

## Set permissions from the NAS web interface
- Enable Advanced Folder Permissions

## Mount on the host server
- Mounting with NFS mode is not safe and thus it is disabled as of now. So, we will mount the NAS volume using CIFS.

```bash
sudo mount -t cifs //10.0.62.201/foldername directory_path_in_server -o username=username,password=password,uid=uid,gid=gid,file_mode=file_mode,dir_mode=dir_mode
```

Meanings of the arguments:

| Argument  | Meaning                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| username  | Username of the NAS account                        |
| password  | Password of the NAS account                        |
| uid       | User ID on `HOST` (can be viewed by `id` command)  |
| gid       | Group ID on `HOST` (can be viewed by `id` command) |
| file_mode | File permissions                                   |
| dir_mode  | Directory permissions                              |

### Case 1: Mounting a dataset directory for everyone
* Create `dataset` shared folder in the NAS volume.
* Create a dataset directory in the host server.
```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/dataset
```
* Mount the dataset directory in the host server.
```bash
sudo mount -t cifs //10.0.62.201/dataset /mnt/dataset -o username=username,password=password
```

We explicitely chose to not specify `uid,gid,file_mode,dir_mode` so that only root can write inside `/mnt/dataset` in the host server. However, everyone can read from it. So, even the sudo users can not mistakenly delete the data unless they use `sudo` command or login as `root`. Default file_mode is 0644 (read/write for owner, read for group and others) and default dir_mode is 0755 (read/write/execute for owner, read/execute for group and others).

### Case 2: Mounting a personal directory for a specific user
* Create `personal` shared folder in the NAS volume.
* Create a personal directory in the host server.
```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/personal
```
* Get the uid and gid of the user.
```bash
id username
```

* Mount the personal directory in the host server.
```bash
sudo mount -t cifs //10.0.62.201/dataset /mnt/dataset -o username=username,password=password,uid=uid,gid=gid,file_mode=0600,dir_mode=0700
```

file_mode=0600 and dir_mode=0700 ensures that only the user can read/write inside `/mnt/personal` in the host server. No one else can read/write inside it.

### Case 3: Mounting a shared directory where one user can write and others can read
* Create `shared` shared folder in the NAS volume.
* Create a shared directory in the host server.
```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/shared
```
* Get the uid and gid of the user.
```bash
id username
```

* Mount the shared directory in the host server.
```bash
sudo mount -t cifs //10.0.62.201/dataset /mnt/dataset -o username=username,password=password,uid=uid,gid=gid,file_mode=0644,dir_mode=0755
```
or
```bash
sudo mount -t cifs //10.0.62.201/dataset /mnt/dataset -o username=username,password=password,uid=uid,gid=gid
```

file_mode=0644 and dir_mode=0755 ensures that the user can read/write inside `/mnt/shared` in the host server. Others can only read from it. This is also the default behaviour.
