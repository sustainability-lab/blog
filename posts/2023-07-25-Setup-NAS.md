## QNAP NAS Setup

- Source: [QNAP NAS Setup](https://www.qnap.com/en/how-to/faq/article/how-to-configure-sub-folders-acl-for-nfs-clients)

## Setup

- At the time of writing, we have a QNAP NAS with 6 HDDs with 16 TB storage space each. The total storage space is 96 TB. The NAS is connected to the network and is accessible via the IP address `10.0.62.201`.
- I want to try with two HDDs first in RAID 1 configuration. I will add more HDDs later. So, this amounts to total 16 TB storage space with 1 hard-disk failure tolerance.
